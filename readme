2. Fork Repository from CDC GitHub Site
Choose a repository from the CDC GitHub site that uses the R language.
Fork the selected repository to your GitHub account for customization.
3. Use Private GitHub Action Runners

Set up and configure private runners to execute GitHub Actions workflows securely.
Task 2: Implementing Security Measures
To implement security measures for the repositories, follow these steps:

1. Enable CVE Scanning and SBOM Creation
Utilize Anchore open-source tooling to perform CVE scanning and generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for the repositories.
Configure Anchore to scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies and create SBOMs as part of the CI/CD pipelines.
2. Enable Dependabot
